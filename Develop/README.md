# Professional README Generator
## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a way for Readme files to be generated efficiently and quickly.
This project was built to help users like me create a Readme quickly in order to focus on the project at hand.
It solved having to manually write a Readme for any project.
During this project I learned how to write code that will generate a Readme file.

This project stands out because it creates a tool that will help many users that code.
## Installation
The simple command of node followed by the file name will generate the Readme
